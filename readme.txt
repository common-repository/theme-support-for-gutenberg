Instantly add integrated support for Gutenberg to most existing themes. Includes wide and full align styling.

== Description ==

Gutenberg is coming! A major problem with Gutenberg is that essentially all existing themes to not have integrated support for Gutenberg features. One of the most interesting new features of Gutenberg is wide and full alignment for many of its blocks.

This plugin allows most existing WordPress themes to be compatible with Gutenberg. This plugin supports the new wide and full align for Gutenberg. which works best on pages and posts without sidebars.

Please note that the plugin support is mostly for the visitor front-end view of your site. While there is some improved styling for the Edit view, you will probably not get a true WYSIWYG experience until themes have been explicitly modified to provide full Edit back-end support for Gutenberg.

This plugin also provides good looking default styling for most Gutenberg blocks - many which include really new elements for your posts and pages.

Once you install this plugin, it will seamlessly and automatically integrate with most existing themes, and the alignwide and alignfull editor options will become available for those blocks that support them. This plugins doesn't have or need any options.

This plugin also adds an Edit (Classic) button to the admin bar to help you with the transition to Gutenberg. This button is most useful for switching to the Classic editor for creating new content, or editing old, non-Gutenberg content. (Caution! You cannot edit Gutenberg blocks with the classic editor - even in HTML mode. The slightest change, including fixing spelling, will "break" the block, and cause error messages when back in Gutenberg. This may seem like a bad thing, but it is not. It is essential to keep block content from being corrupted.)

Eventually, it is almost certain that many WordPress themes will add their own Gutenberg support. But for now, you can come close to a complete Gutenberg editing experience with this plugin. If you want to check out a theme that has total integration with Gutenberg, try our Weaver Xtreme theme. It is completely options based, and gives you total control over your site's design, and you can see what Gutenberg really offers!

= A Great WordPress Theme with full Gutenberg Integration =

As of the time of release of this plugin, there is really only one existing production theme that has full Gutenberg integration, including near 100% WYSIWYG Edit side formatting. This is our theme, Weaver Xtreme. Weaver Xtreme has been in continuous development for almost 10 years, and is option based to allow you to build almost any site imaginable. Along with Gutenberg support, it also has integrations for several page builders. This includes using any post you create with Gutenberg or a page builder to serve as the header or footer.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My theme doesn't really work well with this plugin =

That is possible. Many themes have a rigid structure that really doesn't support alignwide and alignfull. There can be other incompatibilities as well. It is impossible to develop styling that will work with all existing themes. This is especially true for themes that don't let you create pages without sidebars. However, most modern themes, including Twenty-Seventeen for example, work well with *Theme Support for Gutenberg*.

== Screenshots ==

1. WITH THEME SUPPORT FOR GUTENBERG (Twenty-Seventeen) - Normal and Wide Width Alignment looking good!
2. NO THEME SUPPORT FOR GUTENBERG (Twenty-Seventeen) - Normal and Wide Width Alignment are the same.
